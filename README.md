# Introduction
## Hello! My name is Trong, and I'm beyond excited to be taking this Intro to GIS course this quarter. I'm currently a second year MURP concentrating in D&D. 
# Project Idea
## A project idea I have for this course is using GIS to gain a better understanding of factors that determine interest in ADU and smallplex development in different cities across the US. Some cities such as Minneapolis and Portland have recently ended single family zoning and have passed policies that allow the construction of duplexes, triplexes and even fourplexes in lots that were formerly zoned specifically for single-family housing only. These new policies also made it simpler for ADUs to be constructed. Through GIS, I would like to gain a better understanding of how these new policies have impacted the development of smallplexes and ADUs. Have they successfully increased housing stock or is there something else that needs to be done?
# Objective 
## Through this course , I would like to be able to use data science to better critique the success or failures of new policies.
