# Portland ADU and Smallplex Data
## This dataset shows the number of ADU and smallplexes in different neighborhoods across the city of Portland. It can be used to highlight how these housing units impact populations within the city differently.
## I acquired this dataset from a Portland city planner after inquiring about ADU and smallplex numbers in the city after the Residential Infill Project.
